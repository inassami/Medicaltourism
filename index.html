        <h1> Medical tourism in Egypt</h1>
        <p>Egypt was famous for its cities, its mineral and sulfur waters, its dry weather, devoid of moisture, the sand and silt contained in its soil suitable for the treatment of many diseases, and the multiplicity of its beaches and seas with its distinctive natural properties.

 
Sulfur and mineral springs, which are characterized by their unique chemical composition, have spread in Egypt. Which exceeds in its percentage all sulfur and mineral springs in the world. In addition to the availability of silt in the pools of these sulfur springs, with its therapeutic properties, it cures many bone diseases, diseases of the digestive system, respiratory system, skin diseases, and others. It has also been proven that patients with rheumatoid arthritis have been cured by burial in the sand.</p>
        <p>Research also confirmed that the waters of the Red Sea, with its chemical content and the presence of coral reefs, help cure psoriasis. There are many tourist areas that enjoy the advantage of medical tourism in Egypt, and they are areas of ancient historical fame, such as: Helwan, Ain Al-Sira, Al-Ain Al-Sukhna, Hurghada, Fayoum, the Oases region, Aswan, Sinai, and finally the city of Safaga on the Red Sea coast, which possesses all the elements of tourism. The treatment, which is visited by tourist groups, and its fame comes from the fact that black sand has the ability to get rid of some skin diseases.</p>
        <p>
The ancient Egyptians believed that man would be resurrected again after his death to live the life of eternity, and so they were keen to preserve the bodies of the dead by mummifying them, and mummification is a process intended by the ancient Egyptians. Inside the pyramids, and these operations were carried out under the shadow of advanced medical sciences and qualified doctors who were able to use all the abundance of nature in terms of pharmaceutical and chemical materials.</p>
        <p>The state has realized the medical and therapeutic importance of these places, so it has taken care of them and taken care of them, as they have become one of the most prestigious international hospital places.
 
Thus, Egypt occupied a privileged position on the map of medical tourism and became a destination for those wishing to recover from all over the world, where tourists come to it to enjoy a healthy climate and natural medical treatment under the care of specialized doctors in all branches and modern hospitals that have the latest international equipment supported by specialists in exercise and physiotherapy at the highest level level of service .</p>
        <p>There are hundreds of springs and natural wells with mineral and sulfur water in Egypt, which vary in depth, capacity, and temperature between 30 and 73 degrees Celsius. Laboratory analyzes have proven that many of these natural springs contain the highest percentage of sulfur element compared to wells scattered around the world. These natural waters also contain several mineral salts and some minerals of therapeutic value such as sodium carbonate and varying proportions of some metallic elements such as magnesium and iron.</p>
        <p>Laboratory measurements also showed the suitability of the salinity ratio in these natural water resources for hospital purposes, in addition to the spread of wells of pure natural water suitable for drinking, which Egypt has expanded in its investment and production in an economical manner in recent years within the framework of strict scientific control over quality and standard specifications in terms of purity. Impurities, parasites, germs, water hardness and chemical composition, prompting many major national and foreign companies to compete for investment in this field. </p>
        <P>The sands of Egypt were not less rich than its water. Studies have shown that the sand dunes in the Egyptian desert contain safe and beneficial proportions of radioactive elements. Treatment by burying the body or the painful condition of it in sand for studied and specific periods has led to unprecedented results in several rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid disease and pain. Caused by diseases of the spine and other causes of acute and chronic pain, which modern medicine is confused about.</P>
